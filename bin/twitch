# rtmpdump with a shell script because it uses a subprocess library replacement
# that tries to execve() things for some reason. The -c argument claims to dump
# the command, but just dumps it in along all the other debug output, and
# blindly joins the array without quoting :(

# So lets try to salvage that and then pass an actual buffer parameter.
